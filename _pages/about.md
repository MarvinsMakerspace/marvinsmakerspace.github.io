Hello! This is my Blog. I am Marvin and you're viewing this weird about page.

I have no idea why you would do that but here's a little bit of backstory as a reward.

I am a Software Engineer from Germany and in my spare time I try to build little projects. Mostly it will be some Arduino related stuff with some 3D printing and programming.

You can find me here, if you really want to:

If you have any questions feel free to ask them using the email button in the footer of this page. I might even reply.

Happy hacking!
